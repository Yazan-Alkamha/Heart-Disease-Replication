🫀 Heart Disease Prediction – Replication Study
This repository contains my replication of a study comparing different machine learning and deep learning approaches for heart disease prediction. The goal is to reproduce and evaluate the results of the original study using the same dataset and models.

📄 Original Study:
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms – IEEE Xplore

📊 Dataset Source:
Heart Disease UCI – Kaggle


✅ Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Logistic Regression

- Naïve Bayes

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- XGBoost

- CatBoost



📌 INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THIS PROJECT

1. Make sure you have Anaconda installed.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
3. Navigate to this folder (where this file is located).
4. Run the following commands to create the environment:

   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate AIForGlobalChalanges

5. Open the notebook `Yazan_Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.
6. Run all cells.

📁 Note: Make sure the dataset file `heart.xlsx` is in the same folder as the notebook.

✅ This will ensure the code runs with the correct library versions and avoids errors.


🧪 Environment
This project includes a pre-configured Anaconda virtual environment (environment.yml) to ensure consistent library versions and avoid compatibility issues.
